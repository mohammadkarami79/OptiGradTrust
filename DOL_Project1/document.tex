\chapter{Introduction}

In medical imaging, MRI scans are pivotal for diagnosing various neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accurate classification of MRI images into different impairment levels (Mild, Moderate, No Impairment, and Very Mild Impairment) can significantly influence early intervention strategies. However, the traditional centralized approach to model training—where all patient data is aggregated in a single server—faces substantial data privacy and regulatory challenges. Strict privacy laws and ethical guidelines in healthcare limit the sharing of sensitive patient data.

Federated Learning (FL) addresses these concerns by allowing multiple institutions (clients) to collaboratively train a shared global model without exchanging raw data. Each client trains locally on its private data and only transmits model updates (weights or gradients) to a central server, ensuring that patient data never leaves the local environment. This preserves data confidentiality and compliance with privacy regulations, while still benefiting from the diversity of distributed datasets.

\section{Dataset and Task Importance}

We employ an MRI dataset focused on Alzheimer’s disease classification, divided into four categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mild Impairment
	\item Moderate Impairment
	\item No Impairment
	\item Very Mild Impairment
\end{itemize}

Each MRI is resized to $(224 \times 224)$ pixels to fit into a ResNet50-based convolutional neural network (CNN). Correctly classifying these scans is clinically relevant, as early and accurate detection of Alzheimer’s stages can guide timely interventions and potentially improve patient outcomes.

\section{Project Overview}

Our project unfolds in several phases:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Phase 1 (IID Scenario):} We begin by implementing and evaluating three fundamental FL algorithms—FedAvg, FedProx, and FedADMM—under an IID data distribution scenario. This provides a baseline understanding of their performance under ideal conditions.
	\item \textbf{Phase 2 (Non-IID Scenarios):} We then move to Non-IID distributions, such as Label Skew and Dirichlet partitions, and introduce a Byzantine attack scenario to understand how these algorithms handle more realistic and challenging conditions.
	\item \textbf{Phase 3 (Advanced FL Methods):} We explore more advanced and recently proposed FL algorithms that may offer improved robustness or efficiency.
	\item \textbf{Phase 4 (Non-IID + Robustness):} Finally, we incorporate state-of-the-art defense mechanisms (e.g., FLGuard) to mitigate adversarial behavior and improve performance under Non-IID conditions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Centralized Baseline}

Before examining federated scenarios, we first consider a \textbf{centralized training} setup. In this approach, all data is aggregated at a single server and a model is trained directly without any data partitioning or privacy constraints. This scenario provides an upper-bound performance benchmark, as it does not face the limitations of data distribution or privacy-preserving constraints.

\subsection{Centralized Training Results}

We trained a ResNet50-based model for 10 epochs on all aggregated data using Adam (learning rate = $10^{-4}$). The training converged smoothly, and the final test accuracy reached approximately 95.47\%. The classification report indicated high precision and recall across all classes, including the relatively smaller "Moderate Impairment" class.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{centralized_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{Centralized Training: Loss and Accuracy over 10 epochs on the full aggregated dataset.}
	\label{fig:centralized_loss_acc}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{centralized_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{Centralized Training: Confusion Matrix on the Test Set.}
	\label{fig:centralized_confusion}
\end{figure}

This centralized scenario demonstrates the potential accuracy if data sharing were permissible. However, due to privacy constraints in realistic healthcare settings, we cannot rely on such centralization. Federated Learning aims to approach this accuracy while maintaining data decentralization and privacy.

\bigskip

With the centralized benchmark in mind, we now proceed to \textbf{Phase 1}, examining Federated Learning under IID conditions for FedAvg, FedProx, and FedADMM.

\chapter{Federated Learning Algorithms (IID Scenario)}

Federated Learning under IID assumptions simplifies the problem: each client has a similar data distribution, making global model aggregation straightforward. We focus on three baseline algorithms:

\section{FedAvg}

\textbf{FedAvg} is the pioneering FL algorithm. Clients perform local SGD-based training and send their updated weights $\mathbf{w}_i$ to the server. The server aggregates them as:
\[
\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{w}_i^{(t)}.
\]

Under IID conditions, FedAvg typically achieves good convergence. Key hyperparameters impacting performance include local learning rate, local epochs, and batch size.

\section{FedProx}

\textbf{FedProx} extends FedAvg by adding a proximal term to the local objective:
\[
\min_{\mathbf{w}} f_i(\mathbf{w}) + \frac{\mu}{2}\|\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{(t)}\|^2.
\]

This term (controlled by $\mu$) helps stabilize updates, especially when distributions might differ slightly or when clients train for multiple epochs. Even under IID conditions, FedProx can provide a marginal improvement in stability or accuracy.

\section{FedADMM}

\textbf{FedADMM} employs the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to enforce consensus:
\[
L(\{\mathbf{w}_i\}, \mathbf{w}, \{\lambda_i\}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i(\mathbf{w}_i) + \sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_i^\top(\mathbf{w}_i - \mathbf{w}) + \frac{\rho}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\|\mathbf{w}_i - \mathbf{w}\|^2.
\]

The penalty parameter $\rho$ is crucial. Without careful tuning of $\rho$, performance may suffer even under IID conditions. FedADMM has theoretical merits for handling heterogeneous data, but those benefits may not manifest if parameters are not well chosen.

\section{Implementation Details (Phase 1)}

We use ResNet50 as a feature extractor, unfreeze the last 20 layers for adaptation, and apply Adam locally at each client. Data is split equally among clients to simulate IID conditions. We run multiple communication rounds, where each client trains locally for a few epochs, and then the server aggregates the updates.

\chapter{Results and Analysis (IID)}

\section{FedAvg (IID)}

\textbf{Training:} FedAvg converged rapidly, exceeding 99\% training accuracy by the final rounds.

\textbf{Test:} Approximately 94.68\% accuracy. The confusion matrix shows strong performance across all classes. Slightly lower recall on "Very Mild Impairment" is noted, but overall performance is robust and close to the centralized benchmark.

	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedavg_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedAvg (IID): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\section{FedProx (IID)}

\textbf{Training:} FedProx also converged quickly. The proximal term stabilized updates, although this is less critical under IID conditions.

\textbf{Test:} About 95.47\% test accuracy, slightly surpassing FedAvg. This suggests that even under ideal conditions, FedProx’s proximal regularization can yield marginal improvements over FedAvg.

	\caption{FedProx (IID): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\section{FedADMM (IID)}

\textbf{Training:} Convergence was slower. Approximately 88\% training accuracy by the end, indicating more difficulty in reaching consensus.

\textbf{Test:} About 79.75\% accuracy. The relatively poor performance compared to FedAvg and FedProx highlights FedADMM’s sensitivity to $\rho$. With better tuning, it might improve, but in this run, it underperformed.

	\caption{FedADMM (IID): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\section{Comparison under IID}

- \textbf{FedAvg:} ~94.68\% test accuracy.
- \textbf{FedProx:} ~95.47\% test accuracy, marginally better than FedAvg.
- \textbf{FedADMM:} ~79.75\% test accuracy, hindered by parameter sensitivity.

\textbf{Key Insight:} Under ideal IID conditions, FedProx provides a small but notable edge over FedAvg, while FedADMM struggles without proper tuning.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Directions (Post-IID)}

Our IID results establish:
\begin{itemize}
	\item FedProx can slightly outperform FedAvg under IID conditions.
	\item FedADMM requires careful parameter tuning, as it underperformed in this initial attempt.
\end{itemize}

These outcomes serve as a baseline. Next, we investigate more realistic conditions, including Non-IID data distributions and adversarial (Byzantine) clients.

\bigskip

We now proceed to \textbf{Phase 2}, exploring Non-IID distributions (Label Skew, Dirichlet) and a Byzantine attack scenario.

\newpage

\chapter{Phase 2: Non-IID Scenarios and Byzantine Attacks}

Real-world FL scenarios often involve:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Non-IID (Label Skew):} Clients have data biased towards certain classes.
	\item \textbf{Non-IID (Dirichlet):} Data is split according to a Dirichlet distribution ($\alpha=0.5$), introducing random heterogeneity.
	\item \textbf{Byzantine Attack (Adversarial Client):} One client sends negated updates, testing the model’s robustness to malicious behavior.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Non-IID Data and Parameter Influence}

While label skew introduces a known imbalance, Dirichlet partitions create random, unpredictable heterogeneity. FedProx’s proximal term may help handle these variations better than FedAvg. FedADMM, if properly tuned, could theoretically excel, but improper parameter choices may hamper performance.

For the Byzantine attack, none of the current algorithms inherently detect or mitigate adversarial updates, so we expect performance degradation.

\section{Results and Detailed Analysis (Non-IID + Byzantine)}

We present the outcomes for each algorithm under each scenario, along with the corresponding training curves and confusion matrices.

\subsection{FedAvg (Non-IID and Byzantine)}

\textbf{Label Skew:} About 93.04\% accuracy, only slightly less than IID. FedAvg remains fairly robust to mild skew.

\textbf{Dirichlet:} Accuracy ~84.21\%. More challenging than Label Skew. Random heterogeneity affects global generalization.

\textbf{Byzantine Attack:} Collapses to ~35\% accuracy. The adversarial client’s updates dominate, showing no inherent protection in FedAvg.

	\caption{FedAvg (Byzantine): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{FedProx (Non-IID and Byzantine)}

\textbf{Label Skew:} About 92.81\%, similar to FedAvg. The proximal term does not vastly improve performance under mild skew compared to FedAvg.

	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedprox_labelskew_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedProx (Label Skew): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Dirichlet:} About 89.37\% accuracy. FedProx outperforms FedAvg (84.21\%) here, indicating the proximal term’s advantage in handling random heterogeneity.

	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedprox_dirichlet_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedProx (Dirichlet): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Byzantine Attack:} Also collapses to ~35\%. The proximal term offers no defense against adversarial clients.

	\caption{FedProx (Byzantine): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{FedADMM (Non-IID and Byzantine)}

\textbf{Label Skew:} About 74.04\%. Much lower than FedAvg or FedProx, suggesting poor parameter choices for ADMM in this scenario.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\textbf{Dirichlet:} About 69.98\%. Even lower performance, reinforcing the idea that without tuning $\rho$, FedADMM cannot leverage its theoretical benefits in non-IID conditions.

\end{figure}

\section{Comparative Insights (Phase 2)}

\subsection*{Non-IID vs. IID}

All methods showed reduced accuracy under Non-IID conditions. Label Skew was manageable, resulting in mild performance drops, while Dirichlet caused more significant degradation, especially for FedAvg. FedProx handled Dirichlet data better than FedAvg, confirming the proximal term’s utility in handling random heterogeneity.

FedADMM underperformed in both Label Skew and Dirichlet scenarios compared to FedAvg and FedProx, illustrating that without appropriate tuning of $\rho$, its theoretical advantages do not translate into practical improvements.

\subsection*{Byzantine Attack Impact}

All three algorithms collapsed under the Byzantine scenario (~35\%). This stark degradation highlights the need for robust aggregation techniques to identify and mitigate adversarial clients. Without such defenses, even a single malicious participant can derail the global model.

\section{Overall Insights (Phase 2)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{FedAvg vs. FedProx}: While FedAvg and FedProx performed similarly under Label Skew, FedProx outshone FedAvg under Dirichlet conditions, suggesting that the proximal term helps manage random heterogeneity.
	\item \textbf{FedADMM}: Achieved lower accuracy in Non-IID scenarios, reinforcing the importance of hyperparameter tuning. Adjusting $\rho$ might improve results, but we aimed to show that without tuning, ADMM-based methods might lag behind simpler approaches.
	\item \textbf{Byzantine Attacks}: All three methods failed, highlighting a universal vulnerability. This sets the stage for future phases, where we will integrate robust aggregation methods (e.g., FLGuard) to enhance resilience against adversarial behavior.
\end{itemize}

Having analyzed both IID and Non-IID scenarios (with and without adversarial clients), we have a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of FedAvg, FedProx, and FedADMM. FedProx shows promise under heterogeneous conditions, while FedADMM’s potential remains unrealized without parameter optimization. All methods need robust solutions to handle malicious attacks.

\bigskip

This concludes Phases 1 and 2. Next, in \textbf{Phase 3}, we will explore more advanced FL algorithms and evaluate their performance, aiming to improve upon these baseline results and address the identified challenges.

%===========================================================
\chapter{Phase 3: Advanced FL Methods (IID Scenario)}

We now explore advanced FL algorithms:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{FedNova}
	\item \textbf{FedAdam}
	\item \textbf{FedDWA}
	\item \textbf{SCAFFOLD}
	\item \textbf{FedBN}
\end{enumerate}

Our aim: see if these methods can surpass baselines (FedAvg, FedProx, and possibly match or exceed centralized performance) under IID conditions.

\section{FedNova (Definition)}

FedNova normalizes local updates by their effective number of local steps:
\[
\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{w}^{(t)} + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\tau_i \Delta_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\tau_i},
\]
improving fairness and stability.

\subsection{FedNova (IID) Results}

FedNova achieved ~96.01\% accuracy, slightly better than FedProx. Normalization by local steps provides a fairness edge.

	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fednova_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedNova (IID): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\section{FedAdam (Definition)}

FedAdam applies Adam at the server:
\[
m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1)g_t,\quad v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1-\beta_2)g_t^2,
\]
\[
\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{w}^{(t)} - \eta \frac{m_t / (1-\beta_1^t)}{\sqrt{v_t/(1-\beta_2^t)}+\epsilon}.
\]

\subsection{FedAdam (IID) Results}

FedAdam yielded ~46.05\%. Surprisingly low, indicating server-side Adam needs careful tuning or heuristics.

	\caption{FedAdam (IID): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

\section{FedDWA (Definition)}

FedDWA assigns aggregation weights based on inverse local loss:
\[
\alpha_i = \frac{1/(L_i + \epsilon)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} 1/(L_j + \epsilon)}.
\]

\subsection{FedDWA (IID) Results}

FedDWA reached ~95.23\%. Comparable to FedProx, not surpassing FedNova.

\section{SCAFFOLD (Definition)}

SCAFFOLD uses control variates to correct client drift:
\[
\Delta c_i = c - c_i,\quad c \leftarrow c + \frac{1}{N}\sum \Delta c_i,\quad c_i \leftarrow c.
\]

\subsection{SCAFFOLD (IID) Results}

SCAFFOLD achieved ~88.66\%. Better than FedADMM, but not surpassing FedAvg/FedProx/FedNova.

\section{FedBN (Definition)}

FedBN excludes BN mean/var from global aggregation:
\[
\text{Only non-BN parameters are averaged globally; BN statistics remain client-specific.}
\]

\subsection{FedBN (IID) Results}

FedBN reached ~96.25\%, outperforming FedNova and approaching or exceeding the centralized benchmark.

\end{figure}

\section{Analysis of Advanced Methods (IID)}

Test Accuracy Recap:
\begin{itemize}
	\item FedNova: ~96.01\%
	\item FedAdam: ~46.05\% (very low, needs tuning)
	\item FedDWA: ~95.23\%
	\item SCAFFOLD: ~88.66\%
	\item FedBN: ~96.25\% (top performer)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Insights:}
- FedBN and FedNova excel under IID, surpassing FedProx.
- FedDWA performs well but not as high as FedBN.
- SCAFFOLD, despite theoretical merits, underperforms here.
- FedAdam’s poor performance suggests server-side adaptive optimization needs careful adaptation.

\section{Conclusions for Phase 3}

Under IID conditions:
- FedBN emerges as the top performer due to preserving BN statistics locally.
- FedNova also outperforms previous baselines.
- FedDWA, SCAFFOLD, FedAdam require further tuning or scenario-specific adjustments.

These findings prepare us for \textbf{Phase 4}, where we will apply these promising algorithms (e.g., FedBN, FedNova) to Non-IID conditions and integrate robust aggregation methods for handling adversarial clients.

 and this :
\chapter{Phase 4: Advanced FL Methods under Non-IID Conditions and Analysis}

In the previous phases, we evaluated a range of federated learning algorithms under IID (Phases 1 and 3) and Non-IID conditions (Phase 2), as well as their vulnerabilities to Byzantine attacks. We established that while certain algorithms (e.g., FedProx, FedBN, FedNova) can outperform basic methods like FedAvg under IID or mild Non-IID scenarios, the complexity of data heterogeneity and adversarial conditions significantly challenges most approaches.

In this final phase, we take the advanced methods introduced in Phase 3—FedNova, FedAdam, FedDWA, SCAFFOLD, and FedBN—and apply them to Non-IID distributions (Label Skew and Dirichlet) to understand how well their previously observed advantages hold up under more challenging data distributions. We do not consider a Byzantine attack here for brevity, but the outcomes give us insights into how these methods might be extended or combined with robust aggregation techniques later.

\section{Non-IID Scenarios for Advanced Methods}

We revisit two Non-IID distributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Label Skew:} Clients receive data heavily biased towards certain classes. While simpler than a fully random partition, it still introduces class imbalance per client.
	\item \textbf{Dirichlet (with $\alpha=0.5$):} Data is split according to a Dirichlet distribution, creating random heterogeneity. Some clients may specialize in certain classes while others have more balanced subsets, making global consensus harder to achieve.
\end{itemize}

These conditions test whether the advanced methods retain their edge over baseline algorithms (like FedAvg or FedProx) when data distributions are skewed or heterogeneously allocated.

\section{FedNova under Non-IID Conditions}

\subsection{Label Skew}
Under label skew, FedNova achieved about 90.62\% accuracy. Compared to the baseline methods under Label Skew (where FedAvg was around 93.04\% and FedProx around 92.81\%), FedNova performed moderately well but did not surpass the best baseline results this time. Although FedNova excelled under IID (96.01\%), its advantage diminishes somewhat in skewed conditions. This suggests that while normalizing updates by local steps helps under IID, the complexity of label imbalance may require additional strategies.

The confusion matrix indicated a good balance across classes, but with slightly reduced performance on some minority or heavily skewed classes. Still, a 90.62\% accuracy is robust, indicating that FedNova remains competitive under moderate skew.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fednova_labelskew_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FedNova (Label Skew): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

As seen in the above figure, while FedNova converges, the presence of label skew slows down the achievement of peak accuracy. Nonetheless, it reaches a stable performance close to 90.62\%.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fednova_labelskew_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedNova (Label Skew): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix for FedNova under Label Skew reflects that while all classes are recognized, minority classes under skew conditions receive slightly less accurate predictions.

\subsection{Dirichlet}
Under the Dirichlet distribution, FedNova achieved about 85.77\% accuracy. Previously, FedAvg under Dirichlet was around 84.21\% and FedProx around 89.37\%. Here, FedNova did not surpass FedProx’s strong showing under Dirichlet. The complexity of random heterogeneity proved challenging. Nonetheless, FedNova improved upon a pure baseline like FedAvg, showing it retains some benefit over naive averaging methods.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fednova_dirichlet_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FedNova (Dirichlet): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

In the above figure, we see that under Dirichlet Non-IID, FedNova's convergence is stable but capped around 85.77\% accuracy, indicating difficulty in reconciling the diverse distributions.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fednova_dirichlet_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedNova (Dirichlet): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix under Dirichlet shows that while all classes are recognized, the variance in class distributions across clients leads to some classes being learned less consistently.

\section{FedAdam under Non-IID Conditions}

\subsection{Label Skew}
FedAdam under label skew delivered around 45.27\% accuracy. Previously, FedAdam struggled even under IID conditions, and here the performance remains poor. Despite stable or even high training accuracy locally, the global consensus was not achieved effectively. The adaptive server-side update, without careful parameter tuning or additional heuristics, fails to capitalize on the distributed data. The classification report showed severe imbalances in predictions, with some classes recognized poorly.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedadam_labelskew_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FedAdam (Label Skew): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

The training dynamics in the figure above show that while training proceeds, FedAdam struggles to improve global accuracy significantly under label skew. The adaptive approach does not align well with skewed distributions.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedadam_labelskew_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedAdam (Label Skew): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix shows poor recognition of some classes, confirming that FedAdam's adaptive global step does not handle skewed distributions effectively.

\subsection{Dirichlet}
Under Dirichlet, FedAdam improved slightly to about 48.79\%, but still remained weak compared to other methods. The challenge of random heterogeneity further complicated the global optimization process. The adaptive approach at the server, when not tuned or accompanied by heuristics to handle client drift, does not yield strong results. FedAdam’s poor performance under both IID and Non-IID scenarios suggests it may need substantial modifications or tuning.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedadam_dirichlet_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FedAdam (Dirichlet): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

As shown above, the training under Dirichlet is unstable, and accuracy plateaus at a low level.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedadam_dirichlet_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedAdam (Dirichlet): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix reflects severe misclassifications. FedAdam’s server-side adaptivity alone is insufficient for Non-IID conditions.

\section{SCAFFOLD under Non-IID Conditions}

\subsection{Label Skew}
SCAFFOLD reached about 86.00\% accuracy under label skew. Compared to baselines (FedAvg ~93.04\%, FedProx ~92.81\%), SCAFFOLD did not surpass them, though it was not far behind. The control variates in SCAFFOLD are meant to reduce client drift, which could help under Non-IID conditions. However, the improvements observed are limited. It achieved a reasonable performance, but not exceptional.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{scaffold_labelskew_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{SCAFFOLD (Label Skew): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

The figure shows that SCAFFOLD converges to a moderate accuracy under label skew, but not at the top-tier levels achieved by other methods.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{scaffold_labelskew_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{SCAFFOLD (Label Skew): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix indicates a decent but not outstanding balance across classes. SCAFFOLD improves stability somewhat, but not enough to beat the best-performing methods.

\subsection{Dirichlet}
Under Dirichlet, SCAFFOLD achieved about 84.05\%. This is similar to FedAvg’s performance (84.21%) and lower than FedProx’s 89.37\%. Given SCAFFOLD’s theoretical advantage in mitigating client drift, one might have expected a stronger result. The outcome suggests that simply adding control variates is not sufficient to outperform methods specifically designed or tuned for heterogeneity (like FedProx) under these conditions. SCAFFOLD improved over some methods but did not become a top performer.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{scaffold_dirichlet_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{SCAFFOLD (Dirichlet): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

Under Dirichlet, the loss and accuracy plot shows SCAFFOLD achieving a respectable plateau, but not exceeding FedProx.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{scaffold_dirichlet_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{SCAFFOLD (Dirichlet): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix under Dirichlet for SCAFFOLD shows it does classify all classes, but not at a top-tier accuracy.

\section{FedBN under Non-IID Conditions}

\subsection{Label Skew}
FedBN reached about 85.07\% under label skew. While FedBN was a top performer under IID conditions (~96.25\%), its advantage narrowed in skewed conditions. This is not surprising, as FedBN’s main trick—keeping BN statistics local—prevents global distortion of normalization layers. However, label skew may still cause model parameters to drift in a way that BN alone cannot fully compensate. Still, 85.07\% accuracy is solid and competitive.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedbn_labelskew_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FedBN (Label Skew): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

As the figure shows, FedBN under label skew converges to a stable accuracy around 85.07\%, still good but lower than its IID performance.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedbn_labelskew_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedBN (Label Skew): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix for FedBN under label skew shows all classes recognized, with some minor drop in accuracy for minority classes.

\subsection{Dirichlet}
Under Dirichlet, FedBN achieved about 87.33\% accuracy. This places it above FedAvg (84.21%) and close to or slightly below FedProx (89.37%) under Dirichlet. FedBN’s strategy of not averaging BN statistics helps maintain stable local normalization, giving it a better chance at generalizing across heterogeneous clients. The result shows that while beneficial, FedBN does not outright dominate all Non-IID scenarios, but it remains a strong contender.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedbn_dirichlet_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FedBN (Dirichlet): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

FedBN under Dirichlet steadily improves and reaches a strong accuracy close to 87.33\%.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedbn_dirichlet_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedBN (Dirichlet): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix under Dirichlet indicates FedBN handles class distribution variations better than FedAvg, though not as well as a tuned FedProx.

\section{FedDWA under Non-IID Conditions}

\subsection{Label Skew}
FedDWA achieved about 83.58\% accuracy under label skew. While it does not outperform the strongest baselines (FedAvg ~93.04%), it remained in a reasonable range. Dynamic weighting based on inverse loss allowed better clients to have more influence, but with skewed data, even the best-performing clients might not represent the global distribution well.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{feddwa_labelskew_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FedDWA (Label Skew): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

As shown above, FedDWA converges to a moderate accuracy under label skew.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{feddwa_labelskew_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedDWA (Label Skew): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix reflects the difficulty FedDWA faces in leveraging dynamic weights to improve performance significantly under skewed data.

\subsection{Dirichlet}
Under Dirichlet, FedDWA reached about 82.41\%. Similar to the label skew scenario, FedDWA does not break the ceiling established by strong baselines or FedProx. Dynamic re-weighting helps, but not enough to surpass specialized methods tailored for heterogeneity.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{feddwa_dirichlet_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FedDWA (Dirichlet): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

The training curve for Dirichlet is stable but limited in final accuracy.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{feddwa_dirichlet_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FedDWA (Dirichlet): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix under Dirichlet shows that while classes are recognized, performance is not top-tier.

\section{Comparative Analysis and Insights (Phase 4)}

\subsection*{Overall Observations:}
- Under Non-IID conditions, the advanced methods do not match their IID performance. Each algorithm’s advantage under IID conditions diminishes when data is skewed or distributed according to a Dirichlet split.
- FedNova, which shined under IID, performs moderately well but not dominantly under Non-IID. It still generally improves over naive averaging but doesn’t beat the best Non-IID tailored methods from Phase 2.
- FedAdam remains problematic. Its poor showing suggests that server-side adaptive optimization without careful tuning is not beneficial in these FL contexts.
- SCAFFOLD, despite its theoretical potential to handle heterogeneity, does not surpass methods like FedProx or FedBN significantly under Non-IID. It performs reasonably but not exceptionally.
- FedBN and FedNova retain some advantage over methods like FedAvg or SCAFFOLD under certain Non-IID conditions, but the margin is smaller. FedBN’s local BN statistics help, but not enough to dominate every scenario.
- FedDWA, while effective in concept, fails to outcompete simpler methods under challenging Non-IID scenarios. Adjusting client weights by their inverse loss helps to some extent, but not drastically.

\subsection*{Comparing to Baselines:}
Recall from Phase 2:
- FedProx often outperformed FedAvg under Non-IID (Dirichlet), achieving ~89.37\%.
- Advanced methods like FedNova and FedBN do better than FedAvg but not consistently better than FedProx in Non-IID settings.
- FedAdam’s results are consistently poor, indicating that naive adoption of adaptive optimization on the server side is not a panacea.

\subsection*{Implications for Future Work:}
The results from Phase 4 underscore the complexity of achieving high accuracy under Non-IID conditions. Methods that excelled under IID lose some of their luster when confronted with skewed distributions. This points to the need for:
\begin{itemize}
	\item More sophisticated aggregation strategies that combine the strengths of methods like FedBN and FedNova.
	\item Parameter tuning or hybrid approaches (e.g., combining FedProx with BN-stat preservation or Nova-like updates).
	\item Integrating robust aggregation techniques to handle not only Non-IID distributions but also potential adversarial behaviors (a future direction hinted at in previous phases).
\end{itemize}

While no single advanced method consistently dominated Non-IID scenarios, each provided insights. For instance, FedBN’s local BN preservation offers stability, and FedNova’s step-based normalization ensures fair contribution. However, these techniques alone are insufficient to fully close the gap to the best-performing Non-IID methods (like a carefully tuned FedProx) or to approach the centralized baseline. Further research might explore combining these strategies or leveraging robust aggregation methods (e.g., FLGuard) to mitigate adversarial influences and better handle heterogeneous distributions.

\section{Conclusion of Phase 4}

The advanced methods tested under Non-IID conditions reveal that no single approach guarantees top-tier performance across the board. While some methods like FedBN and FedNova maintain a competitive edge, they do not universally outperform established robust methods (like a well-tuned FedProx) in heterogeneous settings. SCAFFOLD, FedDWA, and FedAdam each have conceptual merits, but their actual performance under Non-IID conditions falls short of expectations without further tuning or augmentation.

These findings consolidate our understanding:
- Advanced FL algorithms bring theoretical advantages and can shine under IID conditions.
- Non-IID environments erode these advantages unless methods are specifically designed or tuned for heterogeneity.
- The path forward likely involves hybrid methods that combine stability mechanisms (e.g., proximal terms), BN-stat preservation, fair update normalization, and dynamic weighting, along with future robust aggregation strategies against adversaries.

With Phases 1 to 4 completed, we have a comprehensive landscape of how various federated learning algorithms behave under differing data distributions and challenges. Future work will focus on combining these insights to build more resilient and universally effective FL frameworks.
\chapter{Phase 5: Further Improvements for Non-IID Scenarios}

Previous phases established that Non-IID conditions often degrade performance or prolong convergence. In this phase, we address these limitations more aggressively. We focus on two main points:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Enhanced FedBN:} By significantly adjusting hyperparameters and training configurations, FedBN can achieve performance under Non-IID conditions that nearly matches its IID-level results.
	\item \textbf{Potential Enhancements in SCAFFOLD:} Although SCAFFOLD initially did not reach top-tier accuracy, theoretical considerations and preliminary observations suggest that with similar tuning efforts as applied to FedBN, its resilience and stability under Non-IID scenarios could be improved. While we have not yet implemented these enhanced settings for SCAFFOLD, the logical extension of our results with FedBN indicates that SCAFFOLD could also benefit from more rounds, local epochs, or different hyperparameters. Even if it may not surpass FedBN’s peak accuracy, the approach suggests it could achieve greater stability and better handle severe heterogeneity.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Enhanced FedBN Under Non-IID Conditions}

Originally, FedBN showed good resilience to Non-IID data by preserving local BN statistics. However, its final accuracy under Non-IID was not as high as in IID scenarios without further tuning. To bridge this gap, we made the following changes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Increased Local Epochs and Global Rounds:} Instead of 5 local epochs and 10 global rounds, we used up to 10 local epochs and 20 global rounds. This provided more training time and communication cycles to refine local models and aggregate more effectively.
	\item \textbf{Reduced Learning Rate:} Lowering the learning rate (e.g., from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$) allowed the global model to converge more smoothly, especially when clients had disparate distributions.
	\item \textbf{Larger Batch Size and Unfreezing More Layers:} Increasing the batch size (from 8 to 16) improved the stability of the local training steps, and unfreezing more layers of ResNet50 (e.g., 40 layers instead of 20) gave clients deeper adaptation capacity.
\end{itemize}

**Results (Enhanced FedBN):**
- Under label skew Non-IID, enhanced FedBN reached about 95\% accuracy.
- Under Dirichlet Non-IID ($\alpha=0.5$), enhanced FedBN attained around 96\% accuracy.

These results are nearly on par with IID scenarios, showing that Non-IID constraints can be largely mitigated through careful tuning.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedbn_enhanced_labelskew_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{Enhanced FedBN (Label Skew): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

In the above figure, enhanced FedBN quickly converges to a high accuracy (~95\%) despite label skew, closely mirroring its IID performance trajectory.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedbn_enhanced_labelskew_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{Enhanced FedBN (Label Skew): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix for enhanced FedBN under label skew shows balanced class recognition, indicating that the Non-IID penalty has been dramatically reduced.

For Dirichlet:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedbn_enhanced_dirichlet_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{Enhanced FedBN (Dirichlet): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

Under Dirichlet, enhanced FedBN maintains stable and high accuracy (~96\%), approaching IID-level performance even in a more complex distribution scenario.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fedbn_enhanced_dirichlet_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{Enhanced FedBN (Dirichlet): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix under Dirichlet also indicates improved class balance, demonstrating that the careful tuning can neutralize much of the complexity introduced by Non-IID data.

**Interpretation:**
These enhancements confirm that Non-IID conditions do not fundamentally cap achievable accuracy. Instead, they necessitate more training time, careful tuning, and deeper adaptation. Enhanced FedBN shows that near-IID-level accuracy is possible under challenging Non-IID scenarios.

\section{Potential Enhancements for SCAFFOLD}

While we have not yet implemented similar enhancements for SCAFFOLD, the principles derived from FedBN’s success suggest that SCAFFOLD could also improve with:
- More local epochs and global rounds to allow better drift correction.
- A carefully lowered learning rate to stabilize convergence.
- Potential refinements in how control variates are updated to better handle highly heterogeneous data.

Although SCAFFOLD may not achieve the same peak accuracy as enhanced FedBN, these refinements could yield:
- Greater stability under severe heterogeneity.
- More consistent improvement as Non-IID severity increases.
- Reduced performance gap compared to top-tier methods under Non-IID conditions.

Thus, while SCAFFOLD initially lags behind, it likely has untapped potential that can be realized through a similar tuning process.

\section{Conclusion of Phase 5}

Phase 5 demonstrates that Non-IID conditions do not inherently limit final performance. Enhanced FedBN, through extensive hyperparameter tuning, approaches its IID-level accuracy even in Non-IID scenarios (both label skew and Dirichlet). This proves that Non-IID complexity is primarily a matter of training cost and careful adjustment rather than an insurmountable accuracy barrier.

For SCAFFOLD, though currently not tested with these enhanced settings, the logic and lessons from FedBN’s success strongly suggest that SCAFFOLD could also benefit from such adjustments. While it may not surpass FedBN’s top accuracy, it can become more stable and capable of handling severe heterogeneity without severe accuracy penalties.

This sets the stage for the next phase, where robust aggregation strategies are considered to handle adversarial clients, ensuring that even in non-cooperative or malicious scenarios, federated learning can maintain high accuracy.

\chapter*{Phase 6 : FLGuard against Byzantine Attacks(IID)}

All previous phases focused on data distribution challenges (IID vs. Non-IID) and algorithmic improvements. However, a single Byzantine (malicious) client can devastate accuracy if we rely solely on naive averaging. In Phase 6, we implement FLGuard, a robust aggregation strategy, to defend against such adversarial participants.

\section{FLGuard: Concept and Implementation}

FLGuard identifies and neutralizes outlier updates before final aggregation, ensuring that malicious clients cannot sabotage the global model. By comparing pairwise distances, we isolate honest clients’ updates and discard or downweight suspicious ones.

Under our test scenario, we had one adversarial client in an IID environment, sending negated updates. Without FLGuard, accuracy dropped to about 35\%. With FLGuard’s simple outlier detection:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{flguard_iid_byzantine_loss_accuracy.png}
	\caption{FLGuard (IID + Byzantine): Training Loss and Accuracy per Round.}
\end{figure}

The figure shows that after applying FLGuard, accuracy rebounds to about 90.85\%, a vast improvement from the sabotaged baseline.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{flguard_iid_byzantine_confusion_matrix.png}
	\caption{FLGuard (IID + Byzantine): Confusion Matrix on Test Set.}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix now resembles that of a benign scenario, demonstrating that removing adversarial influence restores balanced class recognition.

\section{Broader Implications of FLGuard}

FLGuard proves that robust aggregation is essential. Even advanced FL algorithms cannot inherently defend against malicious clients without a method to filter out harmful updates. FLGuard provides this defense, ensuring that federated learning remains viable and accurate despite the presence of adversaries.

\section{Conclusion of Phase 6}

Phase 6 highlights that, alongside algorithmic and hyperparameter tuning solutions for Non-IID conditions (as in Phase 5), we need robust aggregation strategies like FLGuard to handle adversarial scenarios. By excluding outlier updates, FLGuard retains high accuracy (~90.85\%) even with a fully compromised client.

\bigskip

\section*{Summary of Phases 5 and 6}

\textbf{Phase 5: Enhanced Non-IID Performance}  
Enhanced FedBN achieved near-IID accuracy (95\%-96\%) under Non-IID conditions through careful hyperparameter tuning. Non-IID constraints thus become a matter of increased complexity rather than hard performance caps. Although SCAFFOLD initially underperformed, these insights suggest that with similar tuning, it too could improve its stability and accuracy in heterogeneous environments.

\textbf{Phase 6: FLGuard Against Byzantine Attacks}  
Without robust aggregation, a single malicious client reduced accuracy to ~35\%. Introducing FLGuard, we recovered to ~90.85\%, proving that resilient aggregation methods are necessary to preserve model integrity against adversaries.

Together, these phases show that by combining enhanced algorithmic tuning for Non-IID conditions (e.g., FedBN improvements) and robust aggregation (FLGuard), federated learning can thrive in real-world scenarios—complex, heterogeneous, and potentially adversarial—while maintaining high accuracy.

\chapter{Phase 7: Future Directions and Integration}

In the previous phases, we addressed Non-IID conditions and Byzantine attacks separately and explored how careful tuning (Phase 5) and robust aggregation (Phase 6) can greatly enhance federated learning (FL) performance. Now, we look forward to combining the strongest elements of our study into a single, more powerful approach. Our aim is to integrate the benefits of FedProx, FedBN, and FLGuard to tackle both Non-IID data and adversarial scenarios simultaneously.

\section{Motivation for Combining FedProx and FedBN with FLGuard}

We have seen that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item **FedProx** (from earlier phases) proved effective in Non-IID scenarios, especially under Dirichlet distributions, often outperforming FedAvg. Its proximal term stabilized local training when data distributions varied significantly across clients.
	\item **FedBN**, when enhanced, managed to nearly close the gap between Non-IID and IID performance. By preserving local BN statistics, it handled feature distribution shifts better than other methods.
	\item **FLGuard** provided a robust defense against Byzantine attacks, restoring high accuracy by filtering out malicious updates.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these methods solves a piece of the puzzle:
- FedProx: Addresses heterogeneity and stabilizes training under Non-IID conditions.
- FedBN: Further improves accuracy under Non-IID by maintaining stable normalization layers.
- FLGuard: Protects against adversarial clients, ensuring malicious updates do not derail the global model.

Combining them promises a synergistic effect. With FedProx providing a stable baseline for Non-IID distributions, FedBN enhancing convergence to near-IID accuracy, and FLGuard safeguarding against malicious clients, the resulting approach could yield a federated learning system robust to both challenging data distributions and adversarial attacks.

\section{Proposed Integrated Algorithm}

Our integrated approach could be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item **Local Optimization with FedProx Term:** During local training at each client, we incorporate the FedProx proximal term to keep local weights close to the global model’s weights. This ensures that each client’s update does not deviate excessively, mitigating issues caused by data heterogeneity.
	\item **Local Batch Normalization (FedBN):** We apply FedBN’s strategy of not averaging the BN mean/var across clients. Each client maintains its own BN statistics, preventing global averaging from distorting local normalization. This helps even more when distributions differ significantly, as each client’s normalization layers remain adapted to its own data.
	\item **Robust Aggregation (FLGuard):** At the server side, we implement FLGuard to detect and exclude outlier updates before forming the global model. After receiving client updates (which already benefit from FedProx’s stability and FedBN’s local adaptation), FLGuard ensures that any adversarial or extremely deviant updates are not incorporated into the global model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Putting it All Together (Conceptual Steps)}

1. **Client-Side (Modified FedProx + FedBN):**
- Each client trains locally with a FedProx-like objective:
\[
\min_{\mathbf{w}_i} f_i(\mathbf{w}_i) + \frac{\mu}{2}\|\mathbf{w}_i - \mathbf{w}^{(t)}\|^2,
\]
where $\mathbf{w}^{(t)}$ are the global weights from the previous round.
- The client keeps local BN statistics (as per FedBN), ensuring that normalization layers remain stable and do not degrade under Non-IID conditions.

2. **Server-Side (FLGuard + Weighted Average):**
- Once client updates $\mathbf{w}_i^{(t+1)}$ are received, the server uses FLGuard’s logic to identify outlier (potentially malicious) updates.
- FLGuard excludes or downweights these suspicious updates.
- The server then aggregates the filtered updates (from honest clients) using a weighted average (or simple average if weights are equal) to form the new global model $\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)}$.

\section{Testing the Integrated Approach}

To verify the effectiveness of this combined strategy, we can:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Apply it under one or both of our Non-IID scenarios (Label Skew and Dirichlet). By doing so, we test its ability to handle heterogeneity.
	\item Introduce a Byzantine attack simultaneously. This tests the resilience of the approach in the presence of malicious clients.
\end{itemize}

For example:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item **Scenario 1: Label Skew + Byzantine Attack**
	- Clients have skewed label distributions.
	- At least one client is adversarial, sending negated or crafted updates.
	- Our integrated method should maintain high accuracy despite skew and sabotage attempts.
	
	\item **Scenario 2: Dirichlet Non-IID + Byzantine Attack**
	- Clients receive data splits drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, causing random heterogeneity.
	- Again, at least one client is malicious.
	- The integrated method should approach near-IID accuracies, as shown by enhanced FedBN and FedProx, while FLGuard filters malicious updates to preserve model integrity.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation Details and Resource Requirements}

To achieve these results, we anticipate:
\begin{itemize}
	\item **GPU-Accelerated Training:** Given the complexity and the number of local epochs and global rounds, GPU resources are essential to keep training times reasonable.
	\item **Careful Tuning of Hyperparameters:** Similar to Phase 5, we would need to try different learning rates, local epoch counts, and the FedProx parameter $\mu$ to ensure optimal performance.
	\item **Real-Time Attack Simulation:** For testing FLGuard, we must simulate Byzantine behaviors (e.g., negating updates, adding random noise) to confirm that our integrated approach remains robust.
\end{itemize}

While we have not yet conducted this integrated experiment, we have a clear roadmap. The preliminary results from the phases 1-6 strongly suggest that this combined approach can yield a highly resilient federated learning pipeline capable of handling severe heterogeneity and adversarial conditions simultaneously.

\section{Outlook and Expected Outcomes}

If successful, this integrated algorithm (FedProx + FedBN + FLGuard) could become a key contribution, offering:
\begin{itemize}
	\item High accuracy and stable convergence under challenging Non-IID distributions.
	\item Robustness against malicious clients, ensuring integrity and security of the global model.
	\item A strong baseline for future FL research aiming to deploy in real-world environments with privacy constraints, heterogeneous data, and potential adversarial threats.
\end{itemize}

We aim to perform these integrated experiments and report updated results as we refine the approach further. This paves the way toward preparing a comprehensive research article showcasing how each component (FedProx, FedBN, and FLGuard) complements the others, ultimately providing a stable, accurate, and secure federated learning solution.
