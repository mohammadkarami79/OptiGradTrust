- **Current Memory-Optimized**: 62.55% accuracy, 100% precision
- **Trade-off**: Gained perfect attack detection but lost 34% accuracy

### CIFAR-10 Performance Comparison
- **Previous Verified**: ~50% accuracy, 40% precision
- **Current Memory-Optimized**: 62.56% accuracy, 100% precision
- **Improvement**: Better performance across all metrics

## Recommendations for Optimal Paper Results

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Full-Parameter Test
**Priority: HIGH** - For best possible accuracy and complete attack coverage

**Recommended Configuration:**
- Full epochs (25-50 for convergence)
- Original batch sizes (32-64)
- All 5 attack types: scaling_attack, partial_scaling_attack, sign_flipping_attack, noise_attack, label_flipping_attack
- Extended rounds (10-15) for statistical significance

**Expected Benefits:**
- Restore 99%+ accuracy for MNIST
- Restore 96%+ accuracy for Alzheimer  
- Complete attack analysis for paper
- Optimal performance metrics

### Phase 2: Strategic Dataset Prioritization
Based on verified results analysis:

1. **MNIST + CNN**: Highest potential (99%+ accuracy achievable)
2. **Alzheimer + ResNet18**: Strong performance (96%+ accuracy achievable) 
3. **CIFAR-10 + ResNet18**: Current results actually good, but can be improved

### Phase 3: Progressive Execution Strategy
To manage hardware constraints while maximizing results:

1. **Single dataset comprehensive test** (MNIST first - fastest convergence)
2. **Validate optimal parameters work**
3. **Apply to remaining datasets**
4. **Compare with memory-optimized baseline**

## Hardware Optimization for Full Tests
- Use gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
- Sequential dataset processing
- Model cleanup between datasets
- Background logging to prevent memory leaks

## Timeline Estimation
- **Full Single Dataset Test**: 4-6 hours
- **All Datasets Comprehensive**: 12-18 hours total
- **Staged Execution**: Can run overnight/background

## Paper Impact Assessment

### Current Results Usability
- **Memory-optimized results**: Good for demonstrating robustness and system capabilities
- **Attack detection**: Perfect 100% precision/recall is publication-worthy
- **Accuracy concern**: 62.5% may require explanation of memory constraints

### Optimal Results Potential
- **Full-parameter results**: Would provide state-of-the-art accuracy + robust attack detection
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All 5 attacks across 3 domains
- **Literature comparison**: 99%+ accuracy competitive with top FL papers

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Decision**: Memory-optimized (current) vs Full-parameter testing
2. **If Full-parameter**: Design comprehensive test with optimal configurations
3. **If Current**: Expand to all 5 attack types with memory-optimized parameters
4. **Timeline**: Determine acceptable execution time for paper deadline

**Recommendation**: Proceed with full-parameter comprehensive test for **MNIST dataset first** to validate optimal performance potential, then decide on full execution based on results quality.
